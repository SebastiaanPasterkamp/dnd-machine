# Elf

Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living
in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in
places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests
or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where
soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances
waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art
and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things
of the world.

### Slender and Graceful
With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves
appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and members
of many other races. They are slightly shorter than
humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet
tall to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than
humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and
females are about the same height, and males are only
marginally heavier than females.

Elves’ coloration encompasses the normal human
range and also includes skin in shades of copper,
bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue,
and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no
facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in
bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.

### A Timeless Perspective
Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad
perspective on events that might trouble the shorter-
lived races more deeply. They are more often amused
than excited, and more likely to be curious than
greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty
happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether
adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art,
elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to
make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget
them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to
serious insults with vengeance.

Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible
in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and
compromise to resolve differences before they escalate
to violence. They have been known to retreat from
intrusions into their woodland homes, confident
that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when
the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side,
demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.

### Hidden Woodland Realms
Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among
the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow
vegetables, and their skill and magic allow them to
support themselves without the need for clearing and
plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely
worked clothes and art objects. Their contact with
outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a
good living by trading crafted items for metals (which
they have no interest in mining).

Elves encountered outside their own lands are
commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human
nobles compete for the services of elf instructors to
teach swordplay or magic to their children.

### Exploration and Adventure
Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since
they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of
exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of
human society, which is regimented from day to day but
constantly changing over decades, so they find careers
that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves
also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining
greater magical power, and adventuring allows them
to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against
oppression, and others might become champions of
moral causes.

## Elf Traits
Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the
result of thousands of years of elven refinement.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score
increases by 2.

**Age.** Although elves reach physical maturity at about
the same age as humans, the elven understanding of
adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass
worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood
and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live
to be 750 years old.

**Alignment.** Elves love freedom, variety, and self-
expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler
aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’
freedom as well as their own, and they are more often
good than not.

**Size.** Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and
have slender builds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Darkvision.** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night
sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.
You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it
were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.
You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Keen Senses.** You have proficiency in the
Perception skill.

**Fey Ancestry.** You have advantage on saving throws
against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.

**Trance.** Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they
meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4
hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation
is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a
fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that
have become reflexive through years of practice. After
resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a
human does from 8 hours of sleep.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common
and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and
intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied,
and their songs and poems are famous among other
races. Many bards learn their language so they can add
Elvish ballads to their repertoires.

## Subrace.

Ancient divides among the elven people
resulted in three main subraces: high elves, wood elves,
and dark elves, who are commonly called drow. This
document presents two of these subraces to choose
from. In some worlds, these subraces are divided still
further (such as the sun elves and moon elves of the
Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can choose a
narrower subrace.

### High Elf
As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of
at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of
D&D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which
includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk,
the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the
Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing
themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other
elves. The other type (including the high elves of
Greyhawk, the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon
elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and
more friendly, and often encountered among humans
and other races.

The sun elves of Faerûn (also called gold elves or
sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper,
black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or
black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves)
are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged
with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black,
or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red
are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and
flecked with gold.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence score
increases by 1.

**Elf Weapon Training.** You have proficiency with the
longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.

**Cantrip.** You know one cantrip of your choice from
the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting
ability for it.

**Extra Language.** You can speak, read, and write one
extra language of your choice.

## Wood Elf
As a wood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and
your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through
your native forests. This category includes the wild
elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of
Dragonlance, as well as the races called wood elves in
Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerûn, wood
elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves)
are reclusive and distrusting of non-elves.

Wood elves’ skin tends to be copperish in hue,
sometimes with traces of green. Their hair tends toward
browns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or
copper-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Wisdom score
increases by 1.

**Elf Weapon Training.** You have proficiency with the
longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.

**Fleet of Foot.** Your base walking speed
increases to 35 feet.

**Mask of the Wild.** You can attempt to hide even when
you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain,
falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.
