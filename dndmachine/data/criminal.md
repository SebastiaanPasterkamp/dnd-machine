# Criminal

You are an experienced criminal with a history of
breaking the law. You have spent a lot of time among
other criminals and still have contacts within the
criminal underworld. You’re far closer than most people
to the world of murder, theft, and violence that pervades
the underbelly of civilization, and you have survived up to
this point by flouting the rules and regulations of society.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Deception, Stealth

## Criminal Specialty
There are many kinds of criminals, and within a thieves’
guild or similar criminal organization, individual
members have particular specialties. Even criminals
who operate outside of such organizations have strong
preferences for certain kinds of crimes over others.

### Feature: Criminal Contact
You have a reliable and trustworthy contact who acts as
your liaison to a network of other criminals. You know
how to get messages to and from your contact, even
over great distances; specifically, you know the local
messengers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors
who can deliver messages for you.

### Suggested Characteristics
Criminals might seem like villains on the surface,
and many of them are villainous to the core. But some
have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming,
characteristics. There might be honor among thieves, but
criminals rarely show any respect for law or authority.

### Variant Criminal: Spy
Although your capabilities are not much different
from those of a burglar or smuggler, you learned
and practiced them in a very different context: as an
espionage agent. You might have been an officially
sanctioned agent of the crown, or perhaps you sold the
secrets you uncovered to the highest bidder.
