# Wizard

Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, an
elf closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the
battlefield and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving
in front of her, she completes her spell and launches a
tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts
into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers.

Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes
an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone
floor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and
graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones a
long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle,
bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly
plane beyond.

Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a
gnome tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with
cystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over
them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly,
he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the
passage to his left.

Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united
as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle
weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast
spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception,
and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures
monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the
future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest
spells change one substance into another, call meteors
down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.

### Scholars of the Arcane

Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the
power of magic draws students who seek to master
its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods,
shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical
spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange
words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or
clump of exotic materials, these surface components
barely hint at the expertise attained after years of
apprenticeship and countless hours of study.

Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else
is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment
and grow in experience. They can also learn them from
other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions,
and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are
steeped in magic.

## The Lure of Knowledge

Wizards' lives are seldom mundane. The closest a
wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working
as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching
others the secrets of the muitiverse. Other wizards sell
their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or
pursue lives of crime or domination,

But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the
most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their
libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and
lost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts
in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have
been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets
could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic
available in the present age.

## Creating a Wizard

Creating a wizard character demands a backstory
dominated by at least one extraordinary event. How
did your character first come into contact with magic?
How did you discover you had an aptitude for it? Do
you have a natural talent, or did you simply study
hard and practice incessantly? Did you encounter a
magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the
basics of magic?

What drew you forth from your life of study? Did your
first taste of magical knowledge leave you hungry for
more? Have you received word of a secret repository
of knowledge not yet plundered by any other wizard?
Perhaps you're simply eager to put your newfound
magical skills to the test in the face of danger.
