# Dwarf

Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the
roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers
in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to
clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and
orcs—these common threads unite all dwarves.

### Short and Stout
Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors,
miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they
stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and
compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing
nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are
also easily a match for any of the larger folk.

Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler
hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are
light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth.
Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually
black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have
red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and
groom them carefully.

### Long Memory, Long Grudges
Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the
oldest living dwarves often remember a very different
world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living
in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms)
can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when
orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile
that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a
perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as
humans and halflings lack.

Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains
they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic
endurance and little change. They respect the traditions
of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the
founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth
of the world, and don’t abandon those traditions lightly.
Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the
dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious
labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.

Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to
their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point
of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense
of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have
suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to
the dwarf’s entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf’s
hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.

### Clans and Kingdoms
Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains
where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals
and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and
artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in some
dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth
they can’t find in their mountains, they gain through
trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and
halflings frequently handle trade in dwarven goods
along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races
are welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas
are off limits even to them.

The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and
dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves
who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan
identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves,
and invoke their ancestors’ names in oaths and curses.
To be clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.

Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans,
especially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some
become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after
for their courage and loyalty.

### Gods, Gold, and Clan
Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be
motivated by a desire for treasure—for its own sake, for
a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to
help others. Other dwarves are driven by the command
or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a
desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and
ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might
seek to restore a clan’s lost honor, avenge an ancient
wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within the
clan after having been exiled. Or a dwarf might search
for the axe wielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field
of battle centuries ago.

## Dwarf Traits
Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn
abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 2.

**Age.** Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but
they’re considered young until they reach the age of 50.
On average, they live about 350 years.

**Alignment.** Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly
in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend
toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and
a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of
a just order.

**Size.** Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and
average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your
speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.

**Darkvision.** Accustomed to life underground, you
have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You
can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were
bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You
can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Dwarven Resilience.** You have advantage on saving
throws against poison, and you have resistance against
poison damage.

**Dwarven Combat Training.** You have proficiency
with the battleaxe, handaxe, throwing hammer,
and warhammer.

**Tool Proficiency.** You gain proficiency with the
artisan’s tools of your choice: smith’s tools, brewer’s
supplies, or mason’s tools.

**Stonecunning.** Whenever you make an Intelligence
(History) check related to the origin of stonework, you
are considered proficient in the History skill and add
double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of
your normal proficiency bonus.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common
and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and
guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into
whatever other language a dwarf might speak.

## Subrace
Two main subraces of dwarves populate the
worlds of D&D: hill dwarves and mountain dwarves.
Choose one of these subraces.

### Hill Dwarf
As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition,
and remarkable resilience. The gold dwarves of Faerûn
in their mighty southern kingdom are hill dwarves, as
are the exiled Neidar and the debased Klar of Krynn in
the Dragonlance setting.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Wisdom score
increases by 1.

**Dwarven Toughness.** Your hit point maximum
increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you
gain a level.

### Mountain Dwarf
As a mountain dwarf, you’re strong and hardy,
accustomed to a difficult life in rugged terrain. You’re
probably on the tall side (for a dwarf), and tend toward
lighter coloration. The shield dwarves of northern
Faerûn, as well as the ruling Hylar clan and the noble
Daewar clan of Dragonlance, are mountain dwarves.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score
increases by 2.

**Dwarven Armor Training.** You have proficiency with
light and medium armor.
