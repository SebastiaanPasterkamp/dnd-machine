# Sorcerer

Golden eyes flashing, a human
stretches out her hand and unleashes
the dragonfire that burns in her veins.
As an inferno rages around her foes,
leathery wings spread from her back and
she takes to the air.

Long hair whipped by a conjured wind,
a half elfspreads his arms wide and throws
his head back. Lifting him momentarily off
the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him,
through him, and out from him in a mighty blast
of lightning.

Crouching behind a stalagmite, a bathing points a
linger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs
from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back
behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her
wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.

Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred
upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly
influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces.
One can't study sorcery as one learns a language, any
more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one
chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.

### Raw Magic

Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind,
and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped.
Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an
ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons.
Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them,
a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.

The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly
unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce
exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other
lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most
of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent
flukes. Some sorcerers can't name the origin of their
power, while others trace it to strange events in their
own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a
dryad at a baby's birth, or a taste of the water from
a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery.
So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure
to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the
maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the
inner workings of reality.

Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient
tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they
rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do.
By learning to harness and channel their own inborn
magic, they can discover new and staggering ways
to unleash that power.

### Unexplained Powers

Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it's unusual to find
a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life
in some way. People with magical power seething in
their veins soon discover that the power doesn't like to
stay quiet. A sorcerer's magic wants to be wielded, and
it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if
it isn't called on.
Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic
motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater
understanding of the magical force that infuses
them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others
hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full
potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit
as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making
up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical
knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the
spells they know.

### Creating a Sorcerer

The most important question to consider when creating
your sorcerer is the origin of your power. As a starting
character, you'll choose an origin that ties to a draconic
bloodline or the influence of wild magic, but the exact
source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family
curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or
did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with
inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?

How do you feel about the magical power coursing
through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or
revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or
a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did
you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you
had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you
feel like you've been given this power for some lofty
purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you
the right to do what you want, to take what you want
from those who lack such power. Perhaps your power
links you to a powerful individual in the worldâ€”the fey
creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put
a drop of its blood into your veins, the lick who created
you as an experiment, or the deity who chose you to
carry this power.
