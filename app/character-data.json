A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.\nThe college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another.

After meditating for 1 minute, you learn how the owner acquired and lost the object, as well as the most recent significant event involving the object and that owner. If the object was owned by another creature in the recent past (within a number of days equal to your Wisdom score), you can spend 1 additional minute for each owner to learn the same information about that creature.\n\n**Area Reading.** As you meditate, you see visions of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room, street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube), going back a number of days equal to your Wisdom score. For each minute you meditate, you learn about one significant event, beginning with the most recent.

They adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things-leaves, antlers, or flowers-to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world.\n## Tenets of the Ancients\nThe tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns of taw or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.\n\n* **Kindle the Light.** Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair.\n* **Shelter the Light.** Where there is good, beauty, love. and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand against the forces that would render it barren.\n* **Preserve Your Own Light.** Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can't preserve it in the world.\n* **Be the Light.** Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth in all your deeds.",

Paladins who uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.\n\n* **Fight the Greater Evil.** Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil, I choose the greater evil.\n* **No Mercy for the Wicked.** Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.\n* **By Any Means Necessary.** My qualms can't get in the way of exterminating my foes.\n* **Restitution.** if my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them.
