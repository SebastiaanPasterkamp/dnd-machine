# Paladin

Clad in plate armor that gleams in the sunlight despite
the dust and grime of long travel, a human lays down
her sword and shield and places her hands on a mortally
wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her hands,
the man's wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide
with amazement.

A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak
making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches
an orc war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently.
he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two
ores are-dead before they even realize he is there.
Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to
illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His
spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again
at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its
hideous darkness.

Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are
--united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil.
Whether sworn before a god's altar and the witness of
a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey
beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the
dead as the only witness, a paladin's oath is a powerful
bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior
into a blessed champion.

### The cause of righteousness

A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness,
to stand with the good things of the world against the
encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil
wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various
aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are
bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their
sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to
gods of good, a paladin's power comes as much from a
commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.
Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat,
mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so,
their martial skills are secondary to the magical power
they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite
the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent
and those who join them in the fight for justice.

### Beyond the Mundane Life
Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an
adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him
or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin
lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against
evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the
militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people
can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do
receive the call, these warriors turn from their former
occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes
their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as
leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their
loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to
crown and country.

Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A
delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest
driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of
treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests,
and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the
cosmic balance away from oblivion.

# Creating a Paladin

The most important aspect of a paladin character is
the nature of his or her holy quest. Although the class
features related to your oath don't appear until you
reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading
the oath descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a
devoted servant of good, loyal to the gods of justice and
honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth
to smite evil? Are you a glorious champion of the light,
cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the
shadow, a knight whose oath descends from traditions
older than many of the gods? Or are you an embittered
loner sworn to take vengeance on those who have done
great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven
by your need for revenge? Appendix B lists many deities
worshiped by paladins throughout the multiverse, such
as Torm, Tyr, Heironeous, Paladine, Kiri-jolith, Dol
Arrah, the Silver Flame, Baharnut, Athena, Re-Horakhty,
and Heimdall.

How did you experience your call to
serve as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper
from an unseen god or angel white you were at
prayer? Did another paladin sense the potential within
you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some
terrible event—the destruction of your home, perhaps—
drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into
a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found
yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness
and beauty. Or you might have known from your earliest
memories that the paladin's life was your calling, almost
as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose
stamped on your soul.

As guardians against the forces of wickedness,
paladins are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them
walk the paths of charity and justice. Consider how your
alignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest
and the manner in which you conduct yourself before
gods and mortals. Your oath and alignment might be
in harmony, or your oath might represent standards of
behavior that you have not yet attained.
