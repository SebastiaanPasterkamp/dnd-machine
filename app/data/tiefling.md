# Tiefling

To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer
violence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and
fear in every eye: this is the lot of the tiefling. And to
twist the knife, tieflings know that this is because a
pact struck generations ago infused the essence of
Asmodeus—overlord of the Nine Hells—into their
bloodline. Their appearance and their nature are not
their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which
they and their children and their children's children
will always be held accountable.

### Infernal Bloodline

Tieflings are derived from human bloodlines, and in the
broadest possible sense, they still look human. However,
their infernal heritage has left a clear imprint on their
appearance. Tieflings have large horns that take any
of a variety of shapes: some have curling horns like a
ram, others have straight and tall horns like a gazelle's,
and some spiral upward like an antelopes' horns. They
have thick tails, four to five feet long, which lash or coil
around their legs when they get upset or nervous. Their
canine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are
solid colors - black, red, white, silver, or gold - with no
visible sclera or pupil. Their skin tones cover the full
range of human coloration, but also include various
shades of red. Their hair, cascading down from behind
their horns, is usually dark, from black or brown to dark
red, blue, or purple.

### Self-Reliant and Suspicious

Tieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in
human cities or towns, often in the roughest quarters
of those places, where they grow up to be swindlers,
thieves, or crime lords. Sometimes they live among
other minority populations in enclaves where they are
treated with more respect.
Lacking a homeland, tieflings know that they have
to make their own way in the world and that they have
to be strong to survive. They are not quick to trust
anyone who claims to be a friend, but when a tiefling's
companions demonstrate that they trust him or her,
the tiefling learns to extend the same trust to them.
And once a tiefling gives someone loyalty, the tiefling
is a firm friend or ally for life.
