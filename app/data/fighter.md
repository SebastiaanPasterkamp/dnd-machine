# Fighter

A human in clanging plate armor holds her shield
before her as she runs toward the massed goblins. An
elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers
the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisite
bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping
the two combatants coordinate their assault to the
best advantage.

A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between
the ogre’s club and his companion, knocking the deadly
blow aside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor,
swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles
the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.

A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with
his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving
them around for the crowd’s delight—and his own
tactical advantage. His opponent’s sword flares with
blue light an instant before she sends lightning flashing
forth to smite him.

All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most
diverse class of characters in the worlds of Dungeons &
Dragons. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal
champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries,
and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an
unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a
thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they
are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and
staring it defiantly in the face.

### Well-Rounded Specialists
Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every
fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a
longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes
in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is
adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that
basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a
certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery,
some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some
on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This
combination of broad general ability and extensive
specialization makes fighters superior combatants
on battlefields and in dungeons alike.

### Trained for Danger
Not every member of the city watch, the village militia,
or the queen’s army is a fighter. Most of these troops are
relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic
combat knowledge. Veteran soldiers, military officers,
trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar
figures are fighters.

Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as
adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and
other dangerous work common among adventurers is
second nature for a fighter, not all that different from
the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks,
perhaps, but also much greater rewards—few fighters in
the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic
flame tongue sword, for example.

## Creating a Fighter
As you build your fighter, think about two related
elements of your character’s background: Where did
you get your combat training, and what set you apart
from the mundane warriors around you? Were you
particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a
mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication?
What drove you to this training in the first place? A
threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need
to prove yourself might all have been factors.

You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble’s
army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war
academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history.
Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested.
Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits
of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family
tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and
armor? They might have been military issue or family
heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years
to buy them. Your armaments are now among your
most important possessions—the only things that stand
between you and death’s embrace.
