# Half-Elf

Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither,
half-elves combine what some say are the best qualities
of their elf and human parents: human curiosity,
inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the refined
senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves.
Some half-elves live among humans, set apart by their
emotional and physical differences, watching friends
and loved ones age while time barely touches them.
Others live with the elves, growing restless as they
reach adulthood in the timeless elven realms, while
their peers continue to live as children. Many half-elves,
unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary
wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in
the adventuring life.

### Of Two Worlds

To humans, half-elves look like elves, and to elves, they
look human. In height, they're on par with both parents.
though they're neither as slender as elves nor as broad
as humans. They range from under 5 feet to about 6 feet
tall, and from 100 to 180 pounds. with men only slightly
taller and heavier than women. Half-elf men do have
facial hair, and sometimes grow beards to mask their
elven ancestry. Half-elven coloration and features lie
somewhere between their human and elf parents, and
thus show a variety even more pronounced than that
found among either race. They tend to have the eyes
of their elven parents.

## Diplomats of Wanderers

Half-elves have no lands of their own, though they are
welcome in human cities and somewhat less welcome
in elven forests. In large cities in regions where elves
and humans interact often, half-elves are sometimes
numerous enough to form small communities of their
own. They enjoy the company of other half-elves, the
only people who truly understand what it is to live
between these two worlds.
In most parts of the world, though, half-elves are
uncommon enough that one might live for years
without meeting another. Some half-elves prefer to
avoid company altogether, wandering the wilds as
trappers, foresters, hunters, or adventurers and visiting
civilization only rarely. Like elves, they are driven by
the wanderlust that comes of their longevity. Others,
in contrast, throw themselves into the thick of society,
putting their charisma and social skills to great use
in diplomatic roles or as swindlers.
