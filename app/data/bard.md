# Bard

Humming as she traces her fingers over an ancient ,
monument in a long-forgotten ruin, a half-elf in rugged
leathers finds knowledge springing into her mind,
conjured forth by the magic of her song—knowledge
of the people who constructed the monument and the
mythic saga it depicts.

A stern human warrior bangs his sword rhythmically
against his scale mail, setting the tempo for his war chant
and exhorting his companions to bravery and heroism.
The magic of his song fortifies and emboldens them.
Laughing as she tunes her cittern, a gnome weaves
her subtle magic over the assembled nobles, ensuring
that her companions' words will be well received.
Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves
magic through words and music to inspire allies,
demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create
illusions, and even heal wounds.

### Music and Magic
ln the worlds of D&D, words and music are
not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with
power all their own. The bard is a master of song,
speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say
that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the
words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these
primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout
the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch
and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their
spells and powers.

The greatest strength of bards is their sheer
versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines
in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and
hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable
of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using
their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their
spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than
blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging
knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude
that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become
masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting,
from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.

### Learning from Experience
True bards are not common in the world. Not every
minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal
court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in music
requires hard study and some measure of natural talent
that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard
to spot the difference between these performers and true
bards, though. A bard's life is spent wandering across
the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the
gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer.
But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a
touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.
Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and
their natural desire to travel—to find new tales to tell,
new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the
horizon—makes an adventuring career a natural calling.
Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a
variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost
works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange
places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to
accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A
bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal
experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed.
after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing
mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart
and assume heroic roles themselves.

# Creating a Bard
Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true
or not. Your character's background and motivations
are not as important as the stories that he or she tells
about them. Perhaps you had a secure and mundane
childhood. There's no good story to be told about that,
so you might paint yourself as an orphan raised by a hag
in a dismal swamp. Or your childhood might be worthy
of a story. Some bards acquire their magical music
through extraordinary means, including the inspiration
of fey or other supernatural creatures.
Did you serve an apprcnticeship, studying under a
master, following the more experienced bard until you
were ready to strike out on your own? Or did you attend
a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced
your musical magic? Perhaps you were a young runaway
or orphan. befriended by a wandering bard who became
your mentor. Or you might have been a spoiled noble
child tutored by a master. Perhaps you stumbled into the
clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in
addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?
