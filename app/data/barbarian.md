# Barbarian

A tall human tribesman strides through a blizzard,
draped in fur and hefting his axe. He laughs as he
charges toward the frost giant who dared poach his
people's elk herd.

A half-ore snarls at the latest challenger to her
authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck
with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.
Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into
the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored
elbow into the gut of another.

These barbarians, different as they might be, are
defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and
unthinking fury, More than a mere emotion, their anger
is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting
assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.
For some, their rage springs from a communion
with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling
reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every
barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle
frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and
feats of strength.

### Primal Instinct
People of towns and cities take pride in how their
civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if
denying one's own nature was a mark of superiority. To
a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign
of weakness. The strong embrace their animal natureâ€”
keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage.
Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls
and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands:
the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes
live and hunt.

Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat.
They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over,
giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A
barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few
times without resting, but those few rages are usually
sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.

### A Life of Danger

Not every member of the tribes deemed "barbarians"
by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class. A
true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as
a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar
role as a protector of the people and a leader in times
of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught
with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying
monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger
so that their people don't have to.

Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians
perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a
way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of
the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some
barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the
tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds
formed among the members of their adventuring parties.

## Creating a Barbarian

When creating a barbarian character, think about where
your character comes from and his or her place in the
world. Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin
for your barbarian. Did you come from a distant land.
making you a stranger in the area of the campaign?
Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier
where barbarians are common?

What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you
lured to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you
join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared
threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you
out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee?
Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to
"civilized" lands and only now able to win your freedom.

Or you might have been cast out from your people
because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated,
or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.
