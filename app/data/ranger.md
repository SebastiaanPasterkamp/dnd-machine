# Ranger

Rough and wild looking, a human stalks alone
through the shadows of trees, hunting the ores he
knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching
a shortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of
steel, cutting down one enemy after another.

After tumbling away from a cone of
freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws
back her bow to loose an arrow at the white
dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates
from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends
one arrow after another to find the gaps between the
dragon's thick scales.

Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk
that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his
side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points to
the owlbear he's been tracking and sends the hawk to
distract the creature while he readies his bow.
Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the
hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the
terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of
trackless forests and across wide and empty plains,
rangers keep their unending watch.

### Deadly Hunters
Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in
hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of
civilization—humanoid raiders. rampaging beasts and
monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They
learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving
stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in
brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training
on techniques that are particularly useful against their
specific favored foes.

Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers
acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature's
power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their
combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt.
A ranger's talents and abilities are honed with deadly
focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.

### Independent Adventurers

Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a
guide, or a tracker, a ranger's true calling is to defend
the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters
and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In
some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join
forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are
independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a
dragon or a band of ores attacks, a ranger might be the
first—and possibly the last—line of defense.

This fierce independence makes rangers well suited
to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far
from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced
with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about
the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some
fixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion.
But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can
carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's
foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might
not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in
the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.

## Creating a ranger

As you create your ranger character, consider the nature
of the training that gave you your particular capabilities.
Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds
together until you mastered the ranger's ways? Did you
leave your apprenticeship. or was your mentor slain—
perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your
favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as
part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle,
trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You
might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat
skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature
through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.
What's the source of your particular hatred of a
certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone
you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see
too much of the destruction these monsters cause and
commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is
your adventuring career a continuation of your work
in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change?
What made you join up with a band of adventurers?
Do you End it challenging to teach new allies the ways
of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude
that they offer?
