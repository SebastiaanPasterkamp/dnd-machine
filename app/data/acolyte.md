# Acolyte

You have spent your life in the service of a temple
to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an
intermediary between the realm of the holy and the
mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering
sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the
presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a
clericâ€”performing sacred rites is not the same thing as
channeling divine power.

Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other
quasi-divine being, and work with your DM to detail
the nature of your religious service. Were you a lesser
functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist
the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest
who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a
different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small
cult outside of any established temple structure, or
even an occult group that served a fiendish master that
you now deny.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Insight, Religion

**Languages:** Two of your choice

**Equipment:** A holy symbol (a gift to you when you
entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer
wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common
clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp

### Feature: Shelter of the Faithful
As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who
share your faith, and you can perform the religious
ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring
companions can expect to receive free healing and
care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence
of your faith, though you must provide any material
components needed for spells. Those who share
your religion will support you (but only you) at a
modest lifestyle.

You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated
to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a
residence there. This could be the temple where you
used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a
temple where you have found a new home. While near
your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance,
provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and
you remain in good standing with your temple.

### Suggested Characteristics
Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or
other religious communities. Their study of the history
and tenets of their faith and their relationships to
temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms
and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden
hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken
to an extreme.
