# Half-Orc

Whether united under the leadership of a mighty
warlock or having fought to a standstill after years
of conflict, ore and human tribes sometimes form
alliances, joining forces into a larger horde to the terror
of civilized lands nearby. When these alliances are
sealed by marriages, half-ores are born. Some half-arcs
rise to become proud chiefs of arc tribes, their human
blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc
rivals. Some venture into the world to prove their worth
among humans and other more civilized races. Many of
these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their
mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric customs
and savage fury.

### Scarred and Strong

Half-ores' grayish pigmentation, sloping foreheads,
jutting jaws, prominent teeth, and towering builds make
their orcish heritage plain for all to see. Half-arcs stand
between 6 and 7 feet tall and usually weigh between
180 and 250 pounds.

Ores regard battle scars as tokens of pride and
ornamental scars as things of beauty. Other scars.
though, mark an ore or half-orc as a former slave or
a disgraced exile. Any half-orc who has lived among
or near ores has scars, whether they are marks of
humiliation or of pride, recounting their past exploits
and injuries. Such a half-ore living among humans might
display these scars proudly or hide them in shame.

### The Mark of Gruumsh

The one-eyed god Gruumsh created the ores, and even
those ores who turn away from his worship can't fully
escape his influence. The same is true of half-ores,
though their human blood moderates the impact of their
orcish heritage. Some half-ores hear the whispers of
Gruumsh in their dreams, calling them to unleash the
rage that simmers within them. Others feel Gruumsh's
exultation when they join in melee combat—and either
exult along with him or shiver with fear and loathing.

Half-ores are not evil by nature, but evil does lurk within
them, whether they embrace it or rebel against it.
Beyond the rage of Gruumsh, half-ores feel emotion
powerfully. Rage doesn't just quicken their pulse, it
makes their bodies burn. An insult stings like acid,
and sadness saps their strength. But they laugh loudly
and heartily, and simple bodily pleasures—feasting,
drinking, wrestling, drumming, and wild dancing—fill
their hearts with joy. They tend to be short-tempered
and sometimes sullen, more inclined to action than
contemplation and to fighting than arguing. The most
accomplished half-ores are those with enough self-
control to get by in a civilized land.

### Tribes and Slums

Half-orcs most often live among ores. Of the other races.
humans are most likely to accept half-ores, and half-
ores almost always live in human lands when not living
among orc tribes. Whether proving themselves among
rough barbarian tribes or scrabbling to survive in the
slums of larger Cities, half-ores get by on their physical
might, their endurance, and the sheer determination
they inherit from their human ancestry.
