# Urchin

You grew up on the streets alone, orphaned, and poor.
You had no one to watch over you or to provide for
you, so you learned to provide for yourself. You fought
fiercely over food and kept a constant watch out for other
desperate souls who might steal from you. You slept on
rooftops and in alleyways, exposed to the elements, and
endured sickness without the advantage of medicine or
a place to recuperate. You've survived despite all odds,
and did so through cunning, strength, speed. or some
combination of each.

You begin your adventuring career with enough
money to Jive modestly but securely for at least ten days.
How did you come by that money? What allowed you to
break free of your desperate circumstances and embark
on a better life?

* **Skill Proficiencies:** Sleight of Hand, Stealth
* **Tool Proficiencies:** Disguise kit, thieves' tools
* **Equipment:** A small knife, a map of the city you
grew up in, a pet mouse, a token to remember your
parents by, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch
containing 10 gp

## Feature: City Secrets

You know the secret patterns and flow to cities and can
find passages through the urban sprawl that others would
miss. When you are not in combat, you (and companions
you lead) can travel between any two locations in the city
twice as fast as your speed would normally allow.

## Suggested Characteristics

Urchins are
 shaped by lives of desperate poverty, for
good and for ill. They tend to be driven either by a
commitment to the people with whom they shared life
on the street or by a burning desire to find a better life—
and maybe get some payback on all the rich people who
treated them badly.
