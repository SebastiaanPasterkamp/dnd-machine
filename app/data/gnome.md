# Gnome

A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens
and neighborhoods where gnomes form their close-
knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum:
a crunch of grinding gears hcre, a minor explosion
there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially
bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying
every moment of invention, exploration, investigation,
creation, and play.

### Vibrant Expression
A gnome's energy and enthusiasm for living shines
through every inch of his or her tiny body. Gnomes
average slightly over 3 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45
pounds. Their tan or brown faces are usually adorned
with broad smiles (beneath their prodigious noses),
and their bright eyes shine with excitement. Their
fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction,
as if expressing the gnome's insatiable interest in
everything around.

A gnome's personality is writ large in his or her
appearance. A male gnome's beard, in contrast to
his wild hair, is kept carefully trimmed but often
styled into curious forks or neat points. A gnome's
clothing, though usually made in modest earth tones,
is elaborately decorated with embroidery, embossing,
or gleaming jewels.

### Delighted Dedication
As far as gnomes are concerned, being alive is a
wonderful thing, and they squeeze every ounce of
enjoyment out of their three to five centuries of life.
Humans might wonder about getting bored over the
course of such a long life, and elves take plenty of time
to savor the beauties of the world in their long years, but
gnomes seem to worry that even with all that time, they
can't get in enough of the things they want to do and see.
Gnomes speak as if they can't get the thoughts
out of their heads fast enough. Even as they offer
ideas and opinions on a range of subjects, they still
manage to listen carefully to others, adding the
appropriate exclamations of surprise and appreciation
along the way.

Though gnomes love jokes of all kinds, particularly
puns and pranks, they're just as dedicated to the more
serious tasks they undertake. Many gnomes arc skilled
engineers, alchemists, tinkers, and inventors. They're
willing to make mistakes and laugh at themselves in
the process of perfecting what they do, taking bold
(sometimes foolhardy) risks and dreaming large.

### Bright Burrows
Gnomes make their homes in hilly, wooded lands. They
live underground but get more fresh air than dwarves
do, enjoying the natural, living world on the surface
whenever they can. Their homes are well hidden by
both clever construction and simple illusions. Welcome
visitors are quickly ushered into the bright, warm
burrows. Those who are not welcome are unlikely to
find the burrows in the first place.

Gnomes who settle in human lands are commonly
gemcutters, engineers, sages, or tinkers. Some human
families retain gnome tutors, ensuring that their pupils
enjoy a mix of serious learning and delighted enjoyment.
A gnome might tutor several generations of a single
human family over the course of his or her long life.

### Gnome Names
Gnomes love names, and most have half a dozen or so.
A gnome's mother, father, clan elder, aunts, and uncles
each give the gnome a name, and various nicknames
from just about everyone else might or might not stick
over time. Gnome names are typically variants on the
names of ancestors or distant relatives, though some
are purely new inventions. When dealing with humans
and others who are "stuffy" about names, a gnome
learns to use no more than three names: a personal
name, a clan name, and a nickname, choosing the one in
each category that's the most fun to say.

### Seeing the World
Curious and impulsive, gnomes might take up
adventuring as a way to see the world or for the love
of exploring. As lovers of gems and other fine items,
some gnomes take to adventuring as a quick, if
dangerous, path to wealth. Regardless of what spurs
them to adventure. gnomes who adopt this way of life
eke as much enjoyment out of it as they do out of any
other activity they undertake, sometimes to the great
annoyance of their adventuring companions.

Two subraces of gnomes are found among
the worlds of D&D: forest gnomes and rock gnomes.
Choose one of these subraces.

### Forest Gnome
As a forest gnome, you have a natural knack for illusion
and inherent quickness and stealth. In the worlds of
D&D, forest gnomes are rare and secretive. They gather
in hidden communities in sylvan forests, using illusions
and trickery to conceal themselves from threats or
to mask their escape should they be detected. Forest
gnomes tend to be friendly with other good-spirited
woodland folk, and they regard elves and good fey as
their most important allies, These gnomes also befriend
small forest animals and rely on them for information
about threats that might prowl their lands.

cantrip. lntelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.

gestures, you can communicate simple ideas with Small
or smaller beasts. Forest gnomes love animals and often
keep squirrels, badgers, rabbits, moles, woodpeckers,
and other creatures as beloved pets.

### Rock Gnome

hardiness beyond that of other gnomes. Most gnomes
in the worlds of D&D are rock gnomes, including the
tinker gnomes of the Dragonlance setting.

* **Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 1.

* **Artificer's Lore.** Whenever you make an Intelligence
(History) check related to magic items, alchemical
objects, or technological devices, you can add twice your

(tinker's tools). Using those tools, you can spend 1
hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny
clockwork device (AC 5, I hp). The device ceases
to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour
repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when
you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can
reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up
to three such devices active at a time.

When you create a device, choose one of the
following options:
* **Clockwork Toy.** This toy is a clockwork animal, monster,
or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or
soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves
5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a
random direction. It makes noises as appropriate
to the creature it represents.
* **Fire Starter.** The device produces a miniature
flame, which you can use to light a candle,
torch, or campfire. Using the device
requires your action.
* **Music Box.** When opened. this music box
plays a single song at a moderate volume.
The box stops playing when it
reaches the song's end or
when it is closed.
