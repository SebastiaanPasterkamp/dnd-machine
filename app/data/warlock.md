# Warlock

With a pseudodragon curled on his shoulder, a young
elf in golden robes smiles warmly, weaving a magical
charm into his honeyed words and bending the palace
sentinel to his will.

As flames spring to life in her hands, a wizened
human whispers the secret name of her demonic patron.
infusing her spell with fiendish magic.
Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the
odd alignment of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed tiefling
chants the mystic ritual that will open a doorway to a
distant world.

Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies
hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts
made with mysterious beings of supernatural power,
warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and
spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of
beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and
alien entities of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together
arcane secrets to bolster their own power.

### Sworn and Beholden

A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly
being. Sometimes the relationship between warlock
and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though
the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not
gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon
prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entityâ€”beings
not typically served by clerics. More often, though, the
arrangement is similar to that between a master and
an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in power,
at the cost of occasional services performed on the
patron's behalf.

The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor
but lasting alterations to the warlock's being (such as
the ability to see in darkness or to read any language)
to access to powerful spells. Unlike bookish wizards,
warlocks supplement their magic with some facility
at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light
armor and know how to use simple weapons.

### Delvers into Secrets

Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge
and power, which compels them into their pacts and
shapes their lives. This thirst drives warlocks into their
pacts and shapes their later careers as well.
Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are
widely known. But many warlocks serve patrons that
are not fiendish. Sometimes a traveler in the wilds
comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord
or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully
aware of it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes of
forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student's mind is
opened to realities beyond the material world and to the
alien beings that dwell in the outer void.
Once a pact is made, a warlock's thirst for knowledge
and power can't be slaked with mere study and research.
No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or
she doesn't intend to use the power thus gained. Rather,
the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active
pursuit of their goals, which typically means some kind
of adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of their
patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.
